as if there were 19 Fraction: 1E-05
as much as you 19 Fraction: 1E-05

of the man who 19 Fraction: 1E-05
of the scarlet letter 19 Fraction: 1E-05
on both sides of 19 Fraction: 1E-05
on his way to 19 Fraction: 1E-05
out of his pocket 19 Fraction: 1E-05

that she had been 19 Fraction: 1E-05
that she was not 19 Fraction: 1E-05
the midst of a 19 Fraction: 1E-05
the rest of us 19 Fraction: 1E-05
there is no one 19 Fraction: 1E-05
to be in the 19 Fraction: 1E-05

as he spoke he 18 Fraction: 1E-05
as soon as you 18 Fraction: 1E-05

me that i was 18 Fraction: 1E-05
of the fact that 18 Fraction: 1E-05

she shook her head 18 Fraction: 1E-05
so good as to 18 Fraction: 1E-05
such a way that 18 Fraction: 1E-05
that he was in 18 Fraction: 1E-05
that he would have 18 Fraction: 1E-05
that i had been 18 Fraction: 1E-05
that it was only 18 Fraction: 1E-05
the commander in chiefs 18 Fraction: 1E-05

and it was not 17 Fraction: 1E-05
as far as the 17 Fraction: 1E-05
as though it had 17 Fraction: 1E-05
asked him if he 17 Fraction: 1E-05
at that moment he 17 Fraction: 1E-05
at the time and 17 Fraction: 1E-05

in a few days 17 Fraction: 1E-05
in the evening when 17 Fraction: 1E-05
into the hands of 17 Fraction: 1E-05

on the subject of 17 Fraction: 1E-05
one after the other 17 Fraction: 1E-05
one of the best 17 Fraction: 1E-05
sat down at the 17 Fraction: 1E-05
sat down on a 17 Fraction: 1E-05
soon as they were 17 Fraction: 1E-05
that i should have 17 Fraction: 1E-05
that she would not 17 Fraction: 1E-05
that you are not 17 Fraction: 1E-05
the cause of his 17 Fraction: 1E-05
the greater part of 17 Fraction: 1E-05
the light of a 17 Fraction: 1E-05
the meaning of the 17 Fraction: 1E-05
the old man and 17 Fraction: 1E-05
the presence of the 17 Fraction: 1E-05
the shadow of the 17 Fraction: 1E-05
the sign of the 17 Fraction: 1E-05
the story of the 17 Fraction: 1E-05
the worst of it 17 Fraction: 1E-05
there seemed to be 17 Fraction: 1E-05
there would have been 17 Fraction: 1E-05
to be at the 17 Fraction: 1E-05
to look at her 17 Fraction: 1E-05
to me that he 17 Fraction: 1E-05
to speak of the 17 Fraction: 1E-05
up and down in 17 Fraction: 1E-05
was out of the 17 Fraction: 1E-05
was the cause of 17 Fraction: 1E-05
where there was a 17 Fraction: 1E-05
with an expression of 17 Fraction: 1E-05
with the aid of 17 Fraction: 1E-05
would you like to 17 Fraction: 1E-05
you may be sure 17 Fraction: 1E-05
air of a man 16 Fraction: 1E-05
and he began to 16 Fraction: 1E-05
and i dont know 16 Fraction: 1E-05
and sat down again 16 Fraction: 1E-05
as a result of 16 Fraction: 1E-05
as though she were 16 Fraction: 1E-05
at her with a 16 Fraction: 1E-05
at him with a 16 Fraction: 1E-05
at the corner of 16 Fraction: 1E-05

for a while and 16 Fraction: 1E-05

grew more and more 16 Fraction: 1E-05
had been able to 16 Fraction: 1E-05
had come to the 16 Fraction: 1E-05
hands in his pockets 16 Fraction: 1E-05
have no doubt that 16 Fraction: 1E-05
he thought to himself 16 Fraction: 1E-05
his way to the 16 Fraction: 1E-05
i am afraid that 16 Fraction: 1E-05
i am convinced that 16 Fraction: 1E-05
i did not think 16 Fraction: 1E-05
i have come to 16 Fraction: 1E-05
i have never seen 16 Fraction: 1E-05

if i could but 16 Fraction: 1E-05
in a day or 16 Fraction: 1E-05
in my power to 16 Fraction: 1E-05
in the hope of 16 Fraction: 1E-05

it was impossible for 16 Fraction: 1E-05
lay down on the 16 Fraction: 1E-05
looked at me with 16 Fraction: 1E-05
looked out of the 16 Fraction: 1E-05
nothing of the kind 16 Fraction: 1E-05
occurred to me that 16 Fraction: 1E-05
oclock in the afternoon 16 Fraction: 1E-05
of his head and 16 Fraction: 1E-05
of the battle of 16 Fraction: 1E-05
of the day and 16 Fraction: 1E-05
of the french army 16 Fraction: 1E-05
of the night and 16 Fraction: 1E-05

such as he had 16 Fraction: 1E-05
that he was the 16 Fraction: 1E-05
that i have not 16 Fraction: 1E-05

the door and the 16 Fraction: 1E-05
the evening of the 16 Fraction: 1E-05
the field of battle 16 Fraction: 1E-05
the memory of the 16 Fraction: 1E-05
there would be no 16 Fraction: 1E-05
this part of the 16 Fraction: 1E-05
to be allowed to 16 Fraction: 1E-05
to say a word 16 Fraction: 1E-05

went out to the 16 Fraction: 1E-05
what can i do 16 Fraction: 1E-05
what does it mean 16 Fraction: 1E-05
what he had said 16 Fraction: 1E-05
what he was doing 16 Fraction: 1E-05
what to do and 16 Fraction: 1E-05
when he saw the 16 Fraction: 1E-05
when i think of 16 Fraction: 1E-05
when they came to 16 Fraction: 1E-05
which she had been 16 Fraction: 1E-05
with a sense of 16 Fraction: 1E-05
with him in the 16 Fraction: 1E-05
with his hands in 16 Fraction: 1E-05

a kind of a 15 Fraction: 1E-05
and a pair of 15 Fraction: 1E-05
and as it was 15 Fraction: 1E-05
and as it were 15 Fraction: 1E-05

and put it on 15 Fraction: 1E-05
and said to him 15 Fraction: 1E-05
and said with a 15 Fraction: 1E-05
and she could not 15 Fraction: 1E-05
and there is a 15 Fraction: 1E-05
and told him that 15 Fraction: 1E-05
and when it was 15 Fraction: 1E-05
as he had been 15 Fraction: 1E-05
as soon as we 15 Fraction: 1E-05
at such a time 15 Fraction: 1E-05
at that moment the 15 Fraction: 1E-05
but it is a 15 Fraction: 1E-05
by and by he 15 Fraction: 1E-05
by and by i 15 Fraction: 1E-05
by the fire and 15 Fraction: 1E-05
came up to the 15 Fraction: 1E-05

he did not like 15 Fraction: 1E-05
he pointed to the 15 Fraction: 1E-05
he said at last 15 Fraction: 1E-05
he said it was 15 Fraction: 1E-05
he said that he 15 Fraction: 1E-05
her face in her 15 Fraction: 1E-05
his face with his 15 Fraction: 1E-05

i have had a 15 Fraction: 1E-05
i was in a 15 Fraction: 1E-05
if i were to 15 Fraction: 1E-05
if it were the 15 Fraction: 1E-05
in the open air 15 Fraction: 1E-05
in the world to 15 Fraction: 1E-05
into the room where 15 Fraction: 1E-05
it had been a 15 Fraction: 1E-05
it is true that 15 Fraction: 1E-05
it seemed as though 15 Fraction: 1E-05
it was difficult to 15 Fraction: 1E-05
it was not in 15 Fraction: 1E-05
it was on the 15 Fraction: 1E-05
it was only a 15 Fraction: 1E-05
king and the duke 15 Fraction: 1E-05
like a man who 15 Fraction: 1E-05
me that he was 15 Fraction: 1E-05
now and then a 15 Fraction: 1E-05
of the river and 15 Fraction: 1E-05
of what had happened 15 Fraction: 1E-05
of which he was 15 Fraction: 1E-05
on the faces of 15 Fraction: 1E-05
on the ground and 15 Fraction: 1E-05
out into the street 15 Fraction: 1E-05
quarter of a mile 15 Fraction: 1E-05
received a letter from 15 Fraction: 1E-05
said he with a 15 Fraction: 1E-05
said it was a 15 Fraction: 1E-05
seemed to him to 15 Fraction: 1E-05
she said to the 15 Fraction: 1E-05
she was going to 15 Fraction: 1E-05
side of the river 15 Fraction: 1E-05
so much as a 15 Fraction: 1E-05
so much the more 15 Fraction: 1E-05
so that it was 15 Fraction: 1E-05
that he had never 15 Fraction: 1E-05
that he might have 15 Fraction: 1E-05
that it is not 15 Fraction: 1E-05
that it is the 15 Fraction: 1E-05
that it might be 15 Fraction: 1E-05
that it was necessary 15 Fraction: 1E-05
that there is no 15 Fraction: 1E-05
the best of it 15 Fraction: 1E-05
the command of the 15 Fraction: 1E-05
the end of it 15 Fraction: 1E-05
the last of the 15 Fraction: 1E-05
the life of the 15 Fraction: 1E-05
the middle of a 15 Fraction: 1E-05
the shadows of the 15 Fraction: 1E-05
the shape of a 15 Fraction: 1E-05
the water of life 15 Fraction: 1E-05
there was a little 15 Fraction: 1E-05
there was once a 15 Fraction: 1E-05
to him to be 15 Fraction: 1E-05
to return to the 15 Fraction: 1E-05
to speak of it 15 Fraction: 1E-05
to speak to you 15 Fraction: 1E-05
to think of the 15 Fraction: 1E-05
to think that i 15 Fraction: 1E-05
to which he had 15 Fraction: 1E-05
two or three days 15 Fraction: 1E-05
up his mind to 15 Fraction: 1E-05
up to him and 15 Fraction: 1E-05
was standing at the 15 Fraction: 1E-05
what to do with 15 Fraction: 1E-05
when he was in 15 Fraction: 1E-05
when i came to 15 Fraction: 1E-05
with his back to 15 Fraction: 1E-05
would have been a 15 Fraction: 1E-05
you going to do 15 Fraction: 1E-05
a good look at 14 Fraction: 1E-05
a man who is 14 Fraction: 1E-05
a minute or two 14 Fraction: 1E-05
and as for the 14 Fraction: 1E-05
and gave it to 14 Fraction: 1E-05
and i dare say 14 Fraction: 1E-05
and i knew that 14 Fraction: 1E-05
and it was so 14 Fraction: 1E-05
and that it is 14 Fraction: 1E-05
and there was the 14 Fraction: 1E-05
as i have said 14 Fraction: 1E-05
as it should be 14 Fraction: 1E-05
as much as i 14 Fraction: 1E-05
as well as a 14 Fraction: 1E-05
